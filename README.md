# MWCLABS

This lab experiment typical routing protocol of wireless sensor network is Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol, 
which uses self-organizing and dynamic cluster formation, so it has a problem that cluster headers may have a bad effect on the network. 
This lab will discuss that the quality of network can be optimized through controlling the number of cluster headers in LEACH protocol via the MATLAB simulation.
